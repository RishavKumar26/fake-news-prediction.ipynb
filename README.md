# 📰 Copy of Fake News Prediction

This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** to detect fake news articles.  
It applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze text data and classify whether a given news article is **real or fake**.

## 📌 Project Overview
- Collected and preprocessed a dataset of real and fake news articles.  
- Performed **text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization** (TF-IDF/CountVectorizer).  
- Built classification models using **Scikit-learn** and compared their performance.  
- Evaluated results using metrics such as **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score**.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data handling  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models  
- **NLTK / Text preprocessing tools**  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Visualization  

## 🚀 Features
- End-to-end **text preprocessing pipeline**.  
- Multiple classification models tested (**Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, etc.**).  
- Performance evaluation with confusion matrix and classification report.  
- Scalable solution for other NLP classification tasks.  

## 📊 Results
- Achieved high accuracy in detecting fake news.  
- Logistic Regression/Naive Bayes (depending on dataset) showed the best performance.  
- Demonstrated how **word patterns** and **language features** can help distinguish between real and fake content.  

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Experiment with **deep learning models** (LSTM, BERT).  
- Build an **API or web app** for real-time fake news detection.  
- Improve feature extraction with **word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, or transformers)**.
